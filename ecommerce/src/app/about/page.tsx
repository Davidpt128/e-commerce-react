          Hello! My name is Susan Dittrich and I’m the creator and founder of
          Glowing Beauty My dream of owning a skincare business and website has
          been in the making since 2019. Where did my passion come from? In 1992
          my college roommate and dear friend was putting moisturizer on her
          face. What? Why? We’re only in our very early 20’s. She enlightened me
          with how we need to take care of our skin now for what it will be in
          our later years. I was sold! I ran out and bought Oil of Olay and my
          beginning obsession with skincare began. In 2014 my husband agreed to
          3 pet goats for our youngest daughter. What? We are not farmers! We
          know nothing about goats at all! Fast forward to 2015 and I was bit by
          the “goat bug” and added my first full-size Nubian Dairy goat named
          Sutton’s Bay. That poor girl. She came to my farm which I named Willow
          Tree Farm. I have had a love for Willow trees since I was a little
          girl (about 5) It was amazing that my husband and I fell in love with
          our home that’s surrounded by 13 full-grown Willow Trees. But back to
          my poor Sutton’s Bay. I’m quite sure she hated me in the beginning
          milking days. She earned every single handful of animal crackers for
          putting up with my squeezing and tugging to gather a small bucket of
          goat milk. As a team, she was patient with me, and I improved my
          skills. Goat milk can accumulate quickly so I decided to try making
          goat milk soap and goat milk lotion. That too can accumulate so I
          began to share with my friends and family. I got plenty of
          compliments, so I decided to continue making products to sell on a
          small scale. In 2018 I added a few wholesale businesses and fell even
          more in love with the chemistry and science behind natural skincare. I
          will be receiving a certificate diploma in natural skincare from
          Europe upon completion of my first of many courses I plan to enroll
          in. It has been such an amazing journey for me. A young woman with a
          BA degree in Nutrition/Dietetics, to stay at home mom/wife to a woman
          building her skincare business. Keep your eyes and heart open to the
          things you love. You never know what opportunities will come your way
          and what God will bless you with. I wake up every day feeling blessed
          and in awe of my life journey so far.
